# SFMLTetris
A Tetris clone made to learn SFML and some of the creepy stuff behind game engines. 
Also, to improve my C++ skills

This project was made in 3-4 days. 
I never made nothing using SFML before. So, I'm sorry about the lack of major game loop optimizations.

Also, the code is a little can be a little bit messy.
